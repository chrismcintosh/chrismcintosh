## Recommendations
> ‚ÄúAs a Project Manager at Engage, I worked closely with Chris to identify technical solutions for various client needs. Chris‚Äô ingenuity, collaboration, and positive attitude made him an invaluable member of our team. I would regularly call Chris to discuss theoretical solutions before positioning them before a client, and always left those calls feeling confident, and well versed in our ability to address development requests. If you‚Äôre looking for an experienced, talented, and open minded developer, I would not hesitate to recommend Chris. Chris was an absolute pleasure to work with and would undoubtedly be a valuable asset to any team!" - Patrick Bagley

> ‚ÄúI have worked with Chris for nearly four years. During that time, I‚Äôve known Chris to be honest, hard-working, and talented. From the first week I met Chris, I knew he was someone I could trust. He has consistently demonstrated that level of professionalism. That motivated work ethic, combined with his technical knowledge and talents, positions him to be a leader in our office and company culture. Chris is an incredible asset to any team. He brings a stabilizing and consistent presence, and a great smile and laugh. He shines when he leads internal meetings or directly explains technical language to clients, he is comfortable with both. He brings his technical skills and is an excellent cultural fit. He is someone you enjoy being around inside and outside of the office and I am proud to call him a friend.‚Äù - Ryan Fraase
